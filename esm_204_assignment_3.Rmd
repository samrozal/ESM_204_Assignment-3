```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(rootSolve)
library(janitor)
library(here)
```

```{r}
df <- read_csv(here("data","HW3_data.csv")) %>% 
  select(-1) %>% 
  clean_names()

```

Question 1: Make sure that you are changing the units, because we are given it in lbs but need it in metric tons. I think. make sure things are converted correctly!

```{r}
model_demand_l <- lm(price_cents  ~ q_low_kwh, data=df)
model_demand_h <- lm(price_cents ~ q_high_kwh, data=df)
```
